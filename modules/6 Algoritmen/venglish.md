4. Using list comprehensions and generators to write compact code

## How to study

1. Take the book, read it well and mark anything that's hard to immediately understand
2. Do the exercises at the end of the chapter, using them to understand the text; it will take time
3. Go to the tutorial at the beginning of the week to understand what is expected of you
4. Set quite a bit time apart to work on the programming assignments
5. Always ask for help when you get stuck, even if you think your question is too easy for others
